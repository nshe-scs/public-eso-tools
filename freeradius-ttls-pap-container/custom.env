# Set these values per README or your container won't do anything useful

### General and federation setup ###

# See README for FQDN and realm tips when running multiple containers on the same host.
FR_IDP_FQDN=
FR_IDP_REALM=

## Federation Level RADIUS Proxy (FLR) details
# In the US, we recommend tlrs2.eduroam.us then tlrs1.eduroam.us if you're closer to the west coast; and
# vice versa if you're closer to the east coast. If you aren't sure, ping both to see which is closer.
# We recommend using hostnames for clarity, but FreeRADIUS 3.x only resolves hostnames at startup.
FR_FLR_IP_1=
FR_FLR_IP_2=

# You MUST set the same FLR shared secret on all containers that share the same public IP, since we're
# running RADIUS over UDP. We recommend 63 characters, random.
FR_FLR_SECRET=


## Bootstrapped CA and TLS details
# Your bootstrapped CA cert and private key, exactly as generated by bootstrap-ca.sh; it is safe to reuse
# the CA cert and key with multiple containers under your own control.
FR_TLS_CA_CERT_BASE64=
FR_TLS_CA_KEY_BASE64=

# The container auto-generates a new TLS cert at startup, using your CA cert above. We can't cleanly load
# a new TLS cert while the container is running, so the cert's expiration is effectively the container's
# expiration. You MUST restart (and/or pull/rebuild for updates) before expiration. We recommend 90.
FR_TLS_MAXAGE=


### SP (local wireless) setup ###

## Wireless controller / AP details
## Only leave blank if you're testing or can't offer eduroam to visitors (eduroam is meant to be reciprocal!)

# The shared secret your APs will use when communicating with this container; do not use your FLR secret here.
FR_WAP_SECRET=

# IPs or CIDR subnet of your controller / APs that will talk to this container, comma separated
FR_WAP_IP=

# Leave these blank if you don't want to assign a VLAN to users who authenticate successfully
FR_VLAN_VISITORS=
FR_VLAN_OWNUSERS=


### Identity setup ###

## Choose your identity source, set the values in the corresponding section, and delete the other sections.

# Supported identity sources:
# ldap (your own LDAP servers / AD domain controllers)
# google (Google Secure LDAP service)
# sql (persistent SQLite DB or temporary testing without identities)
# entra (*not yet supported*)
FR_IDENTITY_SOURCE=


## LDAP (self-hosted / MS AD) details

# Choose "ldaps" for LDAPS on port 636 or "starttls" for StartTLS on port 389. If in doubt, choose ldaps.
FR_LDAP_SECURITY=

# The fully qualified names (not IPs) of your LDAP/AD servers, comma separated
FR_LDAP_HOST_FQDN=

# The OU containing all your users, e.g. "ou=users,dc=example,dc=org". Users can also reside in child OUs.
# We don't recommend using the LDAP root ("dc=example,dc=org") unless you're testing.
FR_LDAP_BASEDN=

# Leave blank if all users in the OU above are allowed to use eduroam. Otherwise, specify a group they must be
# a member of, in LDAP distinguishedName format ("cn=eduroam users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org").
FR_LDAP_GROUP_DN=

# This service account binds/queries LDAP before the actual user authenticates. Use LDAP distinguishedName
# format ("cn=foo,ou=bar,dc=example,dc=org") or userPrincipalName format ("foo@example.org").
FR_LDAP_BIND_USER=
FR_LDAP_BIND_PASS=

# The cert(s) that signed your LDAP / Domain Controller's TLS cert (see README for help finding this in AD).
# To convert it into a single line of text you can paste below, run 'base64 -w 0 /path/to/file'.
# If there's no intermediate cert, just leave FR_LDAP_HOST_INTER_CERT_BASE64 blank.
FR_LDAP_HOST_ROOT_CERT_BASE64=
FR_LDAP_HOST_INTER_CERT_BASE64=


## Google (cloud-hosted LDAPS) details

# The OU containing all your users, e.g. "ou=users,dc=example,dc=org". Users can also reside in child OUs.
# We don't recommend using the LDAP root ("dc=example,dc=org") unless you're testing.
FR_LDAP_BASEDN=

# Leave blank if all users in the OU above are allowed to use eduroam. Otherwise, specify a group they must be
# a member of, in LDAP distinguishedName format ("cn=eduroam users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=org").
FR_LDAP_GROUP_DN=

# These are your LDAP Client "application credentials" from the Google admin portal.
# This service account binds/queries LDAP before the actual user authenticates. Use LDAP distinguishedName
# format ("cn=foo,ou=bar,dc=example,dc=org") or userPrincipalName format ("foo@example.org").
FR_LDAP_BIND_USER=
FR_LDAP_BIND_PASS=

# The cert and key you obtained from Google's admin portal when you created an LDAP Client "app".
# To convert each into a single line of text you can paste below, run 'base64 -w 0 /path/to/file'.
FR_LDAP_BIND_GOO_CERT=
FR_LDAP_BIND_GOO_KEY=


## Entra ("native" Entra, use LDAP config instead if you have use managed AD or cloud-hosted AD DCs)
## Not yet supported - placeholder / future release ##


## SQL (sqlite) details
## Nothing to configure - be sure to review the README for information about managing the local sqlite DB.


### Logging setup ###

# Supported logging options:
# syslog (remote syslog server, strongly recommended)
# file (local log file inside the container)
FR_LOG_DESTINATION=

## Syslog details

# FQDN or IP of your syslog server
FR_LOG_SYSLOG_HOST=

# Port number on your syslog server (typically 514)
FR_LOG_SYSLOG_PORT=

# Protocol for syslog: TCP or UDP (we recommend TCP)
FR_LOG_SYSLOG_PROTO=

# Syslog facility FreeRADIUS should log to (we recommend local0, local1, etc.)
FR_LOG_SYSLOG_FAC=

# Syslog severity logs (we recommend info or notice)
FR_LOG_SYSLOG_SEV=

## File details
# Nothing to configure - be sure to persist the container's /var/log/freeradius directory or you'll lose logs
# whenever the container stops. Retaining the console output is NOT sufficient for production use.


### Debugging setup ###
# Set this to "yes" when testing; set to blank or comment it out once you're satisfied everything works.
# This enables incredibly verbose but useful output and also prevents the container from automatically exiting
# so you can check the container's console/logs.
FR_DEBUG=
