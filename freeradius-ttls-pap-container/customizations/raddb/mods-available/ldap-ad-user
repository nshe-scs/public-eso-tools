# Modified so anything starting with FR_ is automagically set based on container env vars
# Designed for use with Microsoft Active Directory - securely bind as a user, then send
# the client credentials in cleartext. This avoids NTLM and MSCHAPv2 which have long been
# rumored to be on the chopping block. However, it's (still) critical that we speak LDAP over
# an encrypted connection to AD, i.e. either LDAPS (636) or LDAP + StartTLS (389).
