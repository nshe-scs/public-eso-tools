Generated CA certificate ($certfile) and key ($keyfile).
Only run this again if you're redeploying from scratch or running containers for
multiple organizations. A new temporary server cert will be used whenever your
container starts, but this CA cert will stay the same and is valid for 20 years.

Securely store this information. If you lose it after your users start using
eduroam, you'll need to re-run this script and reconfigure all your users'
wireless profiles to trust the new CA certificate. That's no fun.

Here they are in base64 encoded format, ready to paste into your container's
environment. Each is a single line, so remove any line breaks when you paste
them in the appropriate place later:

FR_TLS_CA_CERT_BASE64=$(base64 -w 0 $certfile)

FR_TLS_CA_KEY_BASE64=$(base64 -w 0 $keyfile)

And remember: only include the CA certificate ($certfile, NOT the key) in any
wireless profiles you configure, e.g. in eduroam CAT.
